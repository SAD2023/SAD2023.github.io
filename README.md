This was my first time building a website! This was created using html and css. 

It simply tells the Dyatlov Pass Incident. I wanted to practice making a webpage and I thought this might be an interesting event to cover.

- I added some pictures related to the incident.
- I also added a form at the end, though it didn't really go anywhere yet since I didn't know JS at that time.
