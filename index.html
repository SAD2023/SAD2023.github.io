                    <h3>Background Information</h3>
                        <p>The group of ten skiers, led by a 23 year old radio-engineering
                        student Igor Dyatlov, was formed in 1959 for an expedition
                        in the northern Urals of the Soviet Union. Most of the skiers
                        were students in the Ural Polytechnical Institute, as was
                        Dyatlov. They were all Grade-II hikers, expecting to recieve
                        Grade III certification, the highest in the Soviet Union
                        at the time, upon their return. They were heading for the mountain
                        Gora Orten; the hike was considered to be Category III, or
                        most difficult.

                <article id="expedition">
                    <h3>The Expedition</h3>
                        <p>The group took a truck from Ivdel to Vizhai, the last
                        inhabited village in the Northern Province, on the 25th
                        of January, 1959; there, they replenished themselves for
                        the journey. On the 27th, they began to make their way towards
                        Orten. A day after, Yuri Yudin, one of the members who had
                        rheumatism and a congenital heart defect, felt knee and joint
                        pain, and decided to turn back. The remaining nine hiked on.

                        <br><br>

                        From their diaries and cameras, it seems that they arrived
                        at the highland area and started preparing for the climb on
                        January 31st. They cached the surplus food for the return trip
                        in a wooded valley. They started to move through the pass on
                        February 1st, but lost their direction and deviated west, as a
                        result of snowstorms and decreased visibility. They realized
                        their mistake and decided to set up camp for the night on
                        the slope, choosing not to move downhill with better shelter.
                        Later, Yudin would postulate that Dyatlov likely did not want to
                        lose the altitude they had gained, or perhaps he wanted to practice
                        camping on a mountain slope.

                <article id="the incident">
                    <h3>The Incident</h3>
                        <p>Dyatlov had initially agreed to send a telegram to their
                        sports club as soon as the group returned to Vizhai, which was
                        supposed to be no later than the 12th. Before Yudin left, Dyatlov
                        told him that he expected it to take longer. So when the 12th
                        passed, there were no immediate reaction. However, by the 20th,
                        the relatives of the hikers demanded a rescue operation. The first
                        rescue group, consisting of volunteer students and teachers, were
                        sent out. Later, the military and the police became involved, with
                        planes and helicopters being used for the search.</p>


                        <p>Here's where it gets interesting. On the 26th, the search
                        group found the hikers' abandoned tents on the mountain slope.
                        The campsite baffled them. It was empty, badly damaged, and the
                        students' belongings were left behind. The investigators noticed
                        that the tents were cut open from the inside. Sets of footprints,
                        of people wearing a single shoe, only socks, or even barefoot, led
                        to the nearby woods. However, these tracks were covered in snow after
                        about 500 meters.

                        <br><br>

                            <figcaption>Investigators found the tents cut open from
                            the inside. Most of the skiers fled <br> without their clothes.</figcaption>

                        </figure>

                        <br><br>

                        At the edge of the woods, there was visible remains of a small
                        fire, along with two bodies under a large siberian pine.
                        Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, two of the hikers, lay there shoeless
                        and only in their undergarments. Tree branches were broken up to
                        five meters high, meaning someone had tried to climb it.

                        <br><br>

                        Between the pine and the campsite, there were three more corpses:
                        Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin. The poses of their bodies suggested
                        that they were trying to return to the camp. They were found a couple of
                        hundred meters away from each other.

                        <br><br>

                        After about two more months of searching, the remaining four travellers
                        were found under 13 feet of snow in a ravine further into the woods. They
                        were better dressed, and it seems that they were wearing clothes from the
                        other hikers. Signs suggested that those who died first had their clothes
                        relinquished to these other four.

            <section id="examination">

                <article id="investigation">
                    <h3>Examination</h3>
                        <p>Though an initial medical examination concluded that they all
                        died from hypothermia, subsequent examinations of the bodies
                        shifted the narrative. Thibeaux-Brignolles had major skull damage.
                        Both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. Forensic
                        expert Boris Vozrozhdenny stated that the force required to cause
                        such damage would be comparable to a car crash. However, the bodies
                        had no external wounds for the bone fractures, almost as if they
                        had been subjected to extremely high levels of pressure.</p>

                        <p>The four bodies found in the ravine also had soft tissue damage.
                        Dubinina was missing her tongue, eyes, parts of the lips, as well
                        as some facial tissues. Zolotaryov had his eyeballs missing, and
                        Aleksander Kolevatov his eyebrows. However, Vozrozhdenny believed that
                        these soft-tissue injuries occured after their death due to their
                        location in a stream.</p>

                        <p>At first, it was thought that the local Mansi people had murdered
                        the hikers for enroaching on their territories, but the forensic
                        investigator did not believe that the injuries could have been caused
                        by another human being, because the force was too strong.

                        <br><br>
                        The verdict at the time was that the hikers had died from a compelling
                        natural force.</p>

                <h2>Possible explanations</h2>

                <article id="avalanche">
                    <h3>Avalanche</h3>
                        <p>Benjamin Radford suggests that there was an avalanche. He suggests
                        that they group woke up in a panic because they believed that an avalanche
                        was coming or that it had covered their entrance. They cut their way out,
                        poorly dressed because they were sleeping. They probably ran to the nearby
                        woods for safety, and when they believed the danger had passed, they tried
                        to head back. But they were lost in the dark and froze to death. The four bodies
                        found in the river were likely hit by the avalanche, which would explain the
                        fractures.
                        </p>

                        <p>This is debated, because there were no signs of an avalanche when the
                        rescue team got there. An avalanche would have affected the tree line and would
                        have swept all the bodies away as well. The snow in the area was rather shallow
                        too. Over a 100 expeditions have taken place here after this incident, and none
                        have reported conditions for an avalanche. Both Dyatlov and Zolotaryov were
                        master hikers, and they would not have camped in the path of an avalanche.
                        Footprints leading away from the campsite, do not resemble nine people running
                        away in panic; they resemble people walking at a normal pace.</p>

                    <h3>Katabatic Winds</h3>
                        <p>Sweedish researchers suggest that it was Katabatic winds which were
                        responsible for the incident. The explanation goes: the hikers woke up under
                        immense Katabatic winds. Decided to cover their camps in snow and head to
                        the woods for shelter. They built temporary camps to stay in, one of which
                        collapsed and killed four of them. The others possibly froze to death as they
                        tried to make their way back.</p>

                    <h3>Other explanations</h3>

                        infrasound, and paradoxical undressing. But, as of now, the official explanation
                        is that of an avalanche, supported by a repeated investigation in 2015.</p>
